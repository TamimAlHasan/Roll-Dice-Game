        <p>
        <h3>- The game has 2 Players and can be played as Single Player or Multiplayer, playing in rounds.</h3><br>

        <h3>- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result gets added to his current
            score.</h3><br>

        <h3>- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his scores will get lost. After that, it's the next player's turn.
        </h3>
        <br>

        <h3>- The player can press 'HOLD' which means, his current score gets added to his points panel. After
            that, it's the next player's turn</h3><br>

        <h3>- In that case, the points that are saved on the panel will not be lost if the dice rolled to number 1
            on
            the next turn.</h3><br>

        <h3>- The first player to reach 100 or more than 100 points on the points panel, wins the game 🏆</h3><br>

        <h3>- It's a game of luck. So have fun playing with yourself or with another friend 😁</h3>
